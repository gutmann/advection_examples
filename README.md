# Advection examples
Simple python code to illustrate classic advection algorithms.

`advect_core.py` contains the core 1D algorithms.

`advect_examples.py` contains a driver that provides command line options and will run different examples (including plotting the results)

The `older` directory contains some slightly more complex examples, though they are not implemented as cleanly... they do can output an image sequence to make it easy to make movies of the advection processing, and they include both MP-DATA and a flux corrected transport algorithm.
